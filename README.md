## Introduction

This repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C. It is designed to help you understand, practice, and revise the concepts of DSA. Each data structure and algorithm comes with a brief explanation, example code, and test cases. This is also my DSA coding folder where I keep all my DSA practice codes.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa.git](https://github.com/aryan-gupta777/DSA_codes.git)
